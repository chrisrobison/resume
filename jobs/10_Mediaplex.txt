Desc:<p> Since 1999, Mediaplex has been quite successful in traditional online advertising but the recent surge in popularity of new "rich media" ads offered by competing ad vendors had been slowly taking its toll on Mediaplex's bottom line. I was brought on board to lead their rich media effort. I stabilized the existing codebase and managed engineering resources working with the product services team to ensure the successful deployment of all rich media advertising campaigns.</p> <p>Responsible for architecting, designing and managing a flexible software framework that drives the next generation of online rich media advertisements.  This framework is implemented entirely in the client using Javascript and utilizes the latest in web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and AJAX while still maintaining compatibility with older browser software. The Mediaplex Rich Media solution has been designed to be modular, extensible and thoroughly customizable. This new system builds on existing infrastructure, is browser independent, client agnostic (flash/html5/email), has a small footprint and loads quickly and politely (read: unobtrusive and fast loading). </p>
